# How it works? (To be done)

## GAA CLI

Command line to execute actions:

- Create a new model
- Create migrations
- Run migrations

## GAA Server

The server that handles the CRUD UI (React) and the API.

The server does it automatically by reading the models definitions.

2. Autogenerated API to respond to the UI actions
